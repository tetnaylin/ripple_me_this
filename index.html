        <h1>About This Page</h1>
        <h2>What This Web Page Represents:</h2>
        <p>This web page was born out of an effort to envision a scenario where art meets technology... from a university student's perspective!</p>
        <p>The ripples created by the cursor are used to represent the state of mind of university students. Akin to not taking a break from moving the cursor, a person may be overwhelmed by the amount of work and obligations to the point that the full picture may end up becoming too blurry for them. Hence, sometimes taking a breather, represented by stopping the movement of the cursor, may result in a clearer state of mind.</p>
        <h2>How Everything Came To Be:</h2>
        <p>CIRCLES... circles?... RIPPLES! The rest of the elements then snowballed into existence. Now that I have ripples, what could accompany it? Something translucent... something watery... something... shiny? Hence, the water droplets and the glass panel were born. Being the creator of the webpage, you do end up with vertigo from staring at the ripple effect too much. Hence, the remove ripples button was reluctantly born. Finally, you're not a true university student if not having a reference page to credit the owner of the animated cat does not bother you and if you don't include some kind of subjectively hilarious facepalm-worthy material. </p>
